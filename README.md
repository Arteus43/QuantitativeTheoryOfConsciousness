# Quantitative Theory of Consciousness
A Theoretical Space for Identifying Events within a personality framework 

Introduction
Consciousness has been of interest throughout human history. However, answers to questions about how consciousness works have been elusive. Methods for developing greater consciousness, once found, can be difficult to practice. How do human beings become conscious? Is it possible to become more conscious? Is there anything more enlightened than consciousness? This analysis seeks to establish a basis or space in which it will be possible to quantify consciousness.

Analyzing consciousnesss demands an in-depth review of personality. To review an event taken by individuals is complex. One individual might perform an action with more or less consciousness than another. Another might perform an objectionable event opposed to the first, is this second individual more or less conscious? The only real way to confront this question is through a rational discussion of personality. With a map of consciousness it is possible to establish a deeper understanding of personality. In addition to personality a deep dive into consciousness will inevitably analyze the observer effect. Observation of events is linked with consciousness. Is possible to say that an event has become conscious without having been observed? Talking about observation means that we have to understand and know what the observer effect is and how it works in relation to not just events but for the very thoughts with which humans think.
