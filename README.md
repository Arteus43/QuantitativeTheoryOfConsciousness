# Quantitative Theory of Consciousness
A Theoretical Space for Identifying Events within a personaltiy framework 

Introduction
Consciousness has been of interest throughout human history. Answers to questions have been elusive and once found difficult to practice. How do human beings become conscious? Is it possible to become more conscious? Is there anything more enlightened than consciousness? However, this analysis will not answer any of these questions. Instead this analysis will seek to establish a basis or space in which it will be possible to quantify consciousness.

With a map of consciousness it should be possible to establish a deeper understanding of personality. A deep dive into consciousness will inevitably analyze the observer effect. Observation of events is linked with consciousness. Where it is possible to say that when an event has been observed it has become conscious. However, talking about observation means that we have to understand and know what the observer effect is and how it works in relation to not just events but for the very thoughts with which humans think. 

To identify this map of consciousness we must choose a coordinate systems upon which to locate ourselves and we must be very clear about what logical system will be used to identify consciousness. A three dimensional coordinate system that we can collapse into two dimensions as needed. For the logical systems we will use a logical system based on the analysis of whole. A distinction will be made as to whether we will examine concepts as a whole or in detail. Just as it is impossible to analyze a concept in detail without separating it from the whole, it is impossible to localize a concept within the realm of all other concepts unless we remove detail.
