## Introduction:

Personality systems proliferate across the internet. These systems often use concrete analogies to piggyback on a concept or idea that lends itself to describing a certain personality phenomenon. While it is instructive to develop these sorts of systems, concrete, in the box explanations leave a curious feeling of incompleteness. Many people often do use personality systems to both identify some universal truth about the human psyche and at the same time deny that the system has any power to describe them, to place them in a box. However, rational observers must throw out any identification of universal truth based on any system that puts humans within a box. It is illogical, if humans can’t be put in a box then those universal truths about how the psyche works must also be false. There is no concrete rational way to justify relying on wisdom gained from understanding personality theories. Yet countless individuals throughout the centuries have continued to look to personality theories for understanding. If this logic is sound then how are we to rationally understand why personality theories abound.

Further, while it is possible to rationally explore an analogy, the analogy itself defines the logical limits of the analysis. Comparing two related concepts, understanding can be acquired by discovering similarities. Normally these analogies focus on the cause and effect relationships between concepts. For example if we can understand that in one situation an action results in a specific outcome then theoretically that same result or something similar could be expected in related concepts. Except that for personality there is a limited facility with which it is possible to acquire understanding within the logical analysis of cause and effect. It is not possible to assert that a personality will perform any action exclusively as a result of a trigger. Most analogies fall short ineffectively describing relationships between commonly understood actions and personality ideas. For example, to explain the relationship between extroversion and introversion a supposedly simple understanding of the human excitatory response is often used. Simply extroverts receive energy from crowds while introverts receive energy from being alone. While instructive at a high level this analogy between the flush of speaking with others and extraversion falls short when we get into the details of how people interact. However, we can push the boundaries of an analogy, by changing the context in which we explore personality concepts. It is instructive to leave the realm of cause and effect entirely behind. Statistical analysis is the primary method whereby quantum particles are researched. Further quantum particles behave as if certain properties have discrete materializations just like in many personality theories. For example the quantum property of spin has two and only two states, either up or down. While quantum particle theories avoid the term, dichotomy, this is what the two spin states are, a dichotomy. Personality theories abound with dichotomies. Extroversion versus introversion is only one such dichotomy. For this reason it is beneficial to think of personality in quantum terms. Borrowing analogies from quantum systems allows us to overcome the cause and effect paradox, in that we can’t say that an extrovert will always behave in certain ways and have certain outcomes. Humans can not be put in a box. Thinking of personality within quantum terms is instructive. 

A rational thinker can embrace the fact that it is impossible to identify where a human, with a personality, can be located and plotted through a map of possible outcomes, just like it is impossible to identify the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary specificity by the Schrodinger equation. Yet at the same time, due to the sometimes bizarre nature of quantum field effects a quantum particle has dualistic effects. Quantum particles can have superpositions which allow a single particle to have more than one state. For example the quantum quantity of spin always has a value of ½. A neutrino never deviates from this ½ value, but it can have either ½ up or ½ down. Until measured in some way it is impossible to identify a specific value for a given particle. Outside of very specific scientifically defined situations it is impossible to know whether a single neutrino has up spin or down spin. This is very much like how people behave, or at least how they conceive of themselves. If we take people at their word that they really can’t be put in a box, then perhaps it is best to assume that people behave in quantum-like ways. Only quantum effects are truly free. Free because they operate entirely outside the bounds of cause and effect, only statistical analyses can describe where a quantum particle will be. 

Yet at the same time quantum theories always describe properties with discrete outcomes. These properties are disgustingly limited. So limited that, for example, quantum analysis allows an investigator to know without any doubt that there are only two outcomes for particle spin. To be assured knowing particle spin does not in any way contribute to identifying the location of that same particle. Knowing the position of a particle is completely divorced from knowing its quantum properties. To assume that people are not in some way capable of quantum effects means that there is some heretofore unknown way of defining a situation so that an individual’s decisions can be predicted. An investigator would know without any doubt what an individual would do and where they would be in the future. Yet we know from quantum research that from our 3 dimensional perspective it is impossible to know what humankind will do, let alone a specific individual. Taking this analysis as instructive allows a rational mind to then hypothetically use quantum effects as an analogy for personality theory.

It can be shown that a quantum theory can be utilized as an analogy for understanding personality theory. Like with any analogy there will be some comparisons that are beneficial to understanding and some comparisons that are not beneficial. In the current analysis certain aspects of quantum theory will be borrowed to facilitate understanding. In other areas quantum theory won’t work as an analogy. In these areas logic and reasoning will subsume the role of quantum theory to flesh out areas of personality theory. The utility with which quantum theory does and does not work will be discussed. A real personality has more facets, capabilities, and options than current quantum theory allows for. At the same time to whatever extent it is instructive, as much of the Standard Model of Particle Theory as possible will be included, analyzed, and compared. This is done in order to facilitate the analogy. To reiterate, particle theory is completely different from this personality theory, and only takes particle theory as instructive. In this analysis quantum theory will be used as an analogy to identify many fundamental components of the Standard Model within a personality context. Matter, anti-matter, force carriers, as well as certain properties of dark matter will be . The forces themselves could also be described as part of personality theory and can be treated more in depth below.


### The Observer

Like particles, an observer is critical to being able to define important components of personality. Without an observer personality retains amorphous field properties. These field properties are important and by themselves are valuable. So valuable in fact that they are the default description of personality that human beings can ascribe to personality. These personality field effects are described in many forms commonly. Any statement that reflects the discussion above about not being able to put a person in a box or that all outcomes are possible for an individual are all descriptions of quantum personality field effects. Indeed it is possible to reinforce and validate these common assertions using these field effects. Further the only factor that differentiates personality field effects from personality particle effects is the observer. Including the observer collapses the entire personality field into identifiable particles. The reverse is also completely true. An individual who refuses to observe forces the personality particles to resume their field properties. This refusal to observe is actually very beneficial for acquiring field effects. With only the one ability to remove observation a personality can retain  all of the benefits and forces of the field properties. That said the corollary is also true that with the presence of an observer it becomes possible to identify properties and forces that act on personalities. Measurement is possible. Statistically properties can be measured and quantum properties can be identified. Theoretically it can then be possible to understand how personalities interact and therefore build upon. 

The identification of the observer will hereby become a supporting pillar for quantum personality theory. The ability to refuse to observe retains for personalities the ability to form superpositions. Without an observer a personality can retain options for interaction. This identifies a quantum property and is fundamentally different from the observation of Newtonian objects. For example, refusing to observe the earth as a planet that revolves around the sun does not bequeath the earth with any superposition of properties. It is not then possible for the earth to revolve around a different sun or for the earth to stop revolving around the sun. The earth will continue to follow the exact same pattern that it has or the last however many epochs of time. The sun will come up in the morning regardless of whether any human actually looks up at the sky in the morning. If personalities have field effects like superposition of possible states then it must follow quantum laws.

With the identification of the observer the question comes up that if humans have the ability to observe then once observed are they then completely identified. The answer to the question is no. In humans the observer is a conscious capability, indeed observation is not the default state. Therefore it is impossible to always observe. Further it is impossible to observe to the 

## Spin Theory

Having defined some basic ground rules it is now possible to begin the analogy. The simplest particles of quantum theory are neutrinos. Neutrinos have very little mass and only participate in the weak nuclear force. Neutrinos like all other particles have a position and momentum within a defined space. Another quality that neutrinos share with all other particles is spin. Spin can only have two states either up spin or down spin. The value associated with spin for the neutrino is always ½. No other value is possible. Not possible in this case is final and complete, disgustingly complete. In this way it can be defined as a quantum property such that its value is ½ and always is ½. This is way spin is a quantum property and it will not obey logical rules of cause and effect. Spin is limited to this very limited defined set of outcomes. So then by analogy we can define a personality property to have the same spin property. This personality ‘spin’ would have the same properties as particle spin. An individual could have up or down ‘spin’. This personality spin would obey the wave-particle laws such that while observed this facet of personality could be identified as either up or down, but that while unobserved this personality spin would revert to obeying wave functions. In other words there would be no way to know whether the personality was ‘spinning’ up or down. Further that if an observer was introduced to identify spin, the identified spin would be completely independent of whatever outcome had been previously identified. 

to personality that are not necessarily present within particle theory. Namely that personality spin is based on more fundamental properties. Spin has a set of four sub properties. Each of these subproperties retain the basic property of spin. That each one can be either Assuming that it takes four pieces of information to create a three dimensional system it is possible to identify these pieces of information with the arbitrary axes x, y, z, and i. Further that each one of these properties itself has a Turn, either clockwise or counter clockwise (wise or counter). And like their parent Spin there are no other outcomes besides wise and counter. These four pieces of information are two pairs of two all of which are orthogonal to each other, such that two together turn in perpendicular directions. One piece of information is only a point. A piece of information x is enough on its own and is full, no additional inference can be made with only the one datum. A second piece of information can interact perpendicularly with the first. These two pieces of information while full on their own can now be used together to identify a single point. In the same way the third and fourth pieces of information paired can identify a point. Furthermore these two pairs of separate information then interact with each other and because we now have four pieces of information not only is it possible to identify a 2 dimensional plane it is also possible to identify a three dimensional space. Where each pair alone can only identify a point, combining more is possible and a complete map of a 3 dimensional space space can be identified and a point within that space for position of any individual neutrino. This space with each neutrino identifying itself within that space can be mapped into a personality theory where a personality space can be defined. Notice that while the neutrino itself can have four discretely defined turns the location of the neutrino component of personality can be located anywhere within the 3 dimensional personality space. This means that this basic building block of personality is independent of where the neutrino is located. Any personality neutrino can be anywhere. These properties give neutrinos measurable qualities like position and momentum. 

(Matched pairs of position and momentum for particles as well as angular frequency and wave vectors.)

These four turns combine together to create Spin which itself has two expressions in our personality space. These two expressions are opposite to each other, up or down. But together create a whole. In more detail these two expressions of a single neutrino’s spin come from the fact that each turn also has two states, wise (w) or counter (c). A single neutrino’s turns are fixed with respect to each other so that when the spin alternates between up and down each turn flips in tandem with the others. For example if a personality Spin has the combination wcwc in the up expression then in the down expression it has cwcw. Further another neutrino can have the exact opposite combination in the up position cwcw and in the down position it would become wcwc. In this way these two Spins are opposite of each other and yet can occupy the same or close to the same region of space within our proposed personality space. This allows Spins to have additional interaction effects which will be covered later.

For now it is important to identify characteristics of each piece of information. Again this is extending the quantum theory and can not be related with the pure Theory of Particle Physics. However, within the realm of personality theory each turn has identifying characteristics. These characteristics are well discussed within most personality theories and can not be ignored here. Namely that the personality traits identified by the Big Five Personality Traits. These five traits are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These five traits then must become the pieces of information with which we can play within our personality space. Four of these traits are positively associated, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness. The fifth trait, neuroticism, is negatively associated within the Big Five theory. This negative association can be used to distinguish it from the first four. Within the context of this Particle Theory of Personality we will also distinguish it from the first four traits as well. Within this theory, neuroticism and all its derivations, to include its opposite, will become force carriers. These forces will also be discussed further later. Within the Big Five personality system seems to have been created to place personalities within the personality space and therefore it must be possible to have varying degrees of each trait in order to properly identify personality within the p space. That said, for PTP these four personality traits are quantized. Meaning that not only can they be used to describe personality after the fact, but that they define the substrate upon which personality rest. 

The first four traits become the turns: x - openness, y - conscientiousness, z - extraversion, and w - agreeableness, yet within the quantum space they each become a dichotomy allowing for only two possibilities. The possibilities for each turn are as follows. The x turn can be either open or defined. The Y Turn can be either conscientiousness or spontaneous. The Z Turn can be either extraversion or introversion. Finally the W Turn can be either agreeableness or targeted. For each Turn one of the two expressions of turn is positive and the other is negative. By labeling them this way it is also possible to short hand the turn to +x or -x, or for simplicity x or -x. All four turns can be label together this way, eg xyz-w, -x-yzw, or -xyz-w. Open is the positive side of x, conscientiousness is the positive side of y, extraversion is the positive side of z, and agreeableness is the positive side of w. Since every individual has both the up and down sides of each dichotomy everyone is equally negative as well as equally positive. The only difference is that an individual neutrino might have more positive turns in the Up Spin. A simple understanding that these individuals have more negatives in the down position results in fair rules for all neutrinos. 

For the purposes of the PTP all other personality systems should be able to fit within these four axes. Some are themselves defined by four dichotomies. Others do not fit within the dichotomies at all and yet they should be able to be defined by the 4 or 5 traits that the Big Five system identified. The Myers-Briggs Temperament Indicator (MBTI) and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) were both originators of the PTP. The MBTI’s focus on dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and Inferior traits gives itself to the concepts of up and down spin. Where the up spin can be loosely associated with the dominant trait and down spin with the inferior trait.

While in personality systems like the MBTI there is a focus on traits, which can be labeled as for example dominant or inferior. Connotations of these words in them themselves create biases. In PTP Up Spin and Down spin have their own meanings and context regardless of what neutrino and therefore turns are expressed there. The context of the Up Spin is that of the mask we wear for others to see. Down context is that of our inner emotional turmoil. There is nothing dominant or inferior about either context. Instead the up and down Spins are only the spin upon which the trait is given. For example if the z Turn is agreeable and in the up Spin then the neutrino trait will be such that the individual will be able to find connection with others outwardly. In the same pattern if the z Turn is targeted in the up Spin then in the down Spin the neutrino will be agreeable. Agreeableness in the context of the down spin makes the individual seek for connection and agreeableness in the inner world. They won’t necessarily seek to be agreeable in their outward world and thus will be more objective. 

An important distinction must be made within PTP, that while most personality systems ‘type’ an individual as one specific thing. For example a feeler or guardian. Within PTP and because of the Up and Down Spin positions a person’s type is not the Up position or the Down position respectively. Instead as far as it is correct to say that a Spin has a type it is more correct to say that an individual has a ‘Direction’ of Spin. Since both sides of all four Turn dichotomies are present in Spin the distinguishing characteristic is only that the Up turns in whatever positive or negative positions they are in will flip to their opposites in the Down position. The flipping back and forth between to the Spin positions is what is called Direction and can be associated with ‘Typing’ an individual within the PTP Spin theory.

(Either a link to another chapter or a lot more depth into each of the 4 substrate dichotomies Should be given.  Needs expansion.)

The antimatter quadrants for both light and dark sides of matter always reverses the positive and negative qualities of the turns. For example openness is the positive first Turn of light matter, yet openness is the negative Turn of antimatter. This continues for all four Turns. This anti definition within PTP continues to make the Particle Theory of Physics a good analogy. Because of this relationship between the matter and antimatter quadrants of the Spin Theory it is possible to pin some general characteristics to each of these quadrants. Namely that the matter side deals with scarcity. What we need to do or have work to do all fit within the scarcity mindset. The antimatter quadrant deals with that which we already possess. This is why openness becomes a negative characteristic on the antimatter quadrant. Being open with what we already possess will lead to a diminishing of those same possessions. For the same reason being open to new possibilities is positive on the matter quadrant because for that which we don’t already have we need to be open to possibilities for acquiring that which we need. A caveat here is that wanting something which we don’t need is influenced by the dark side quadrants and should be distinguished from our physical needs on the light side.

(Go into more detail about each turn and how it is different for the matter and antimatter quadrants.)

With four Turn dichotomies there are a total of 16 ways a personality Spin can be configured. However, up until now we have been speaking specifically about the matter or material side of the conscious mind. In addition to matter there is an antimatter configuration as well as both a matter and antimatter configuration for the unconscious mind. In regular particle physics light matter and dark matter are described. And the analogy can be extended to PTP as well. The light matter quadrant of personality is readily available for analysis by those who are interested to learn more. The quadrant of personality that is antimatter and on the light side is also accessible by observation, but is more difficult to perceive. This light side antimatter Spin can confuse and muddy perception for anyone seeking to find it. It is important to work through the process of identifying the true light side matter Turns to distinguish the correct display. The dark side matter can not be identified by normal conversation and can only be identified through access to the unconscious. This can be achieved through deep contemplation. Other methods such as hypnosis are very difficult to use because the hypnotist has the very powerful ability to suggest. Suggestion is the way hypnotists cause their patients to enter hypnosis and the only known method of interaction with another’s unconscious at this time. A hypnotized individual will form act upon and form conclusions based on the suggestions or commands they receive from the hypnotist. Therefore the true dark side matter and antimatter turns are usually only available to the individual themselves, through that meditation or deep contemplation.

Since each quadrant of the Spin personality definition has four dichotomous turns. Each therefore has the capability of being one of 16 types. With the four quadrants of the Spin theory there is one in 16 possibilities for each. Therefore there are 65,536 possible personalities for the Spin theory. This is far more complex then any current popular personality theory. However, despite having more possible options it can be recognized that depending on what the individual is focusing on it is possible to identify and even justify almost all personality theories in existence. With so many possibilities it is possible to find and prove how any one of them could fit with the PTP.

## Charge Theory

Now let’s move on to the charge theory of the full PTP. The charge theory is originated on personality systems based on threes or trichotomies. The Enneagram was the most fundamental to exploring charge. However before going straight into describing charge it is important to describe how to link from the Spin theory to the Charge theory. Below is an examination of the link.

In addition to the Up and Down Spin positions each neutrino has three ways of being in the Up or down position. These three ways of being in Spin are positive, negative, and neutral. Specifically this charge can be thought of as a path from the Up and Down Spin positions. Namely two of the turns change at a time through the path to go from Up to Down and the complementary path back from Down to Up. The neutrino does not pause halfway through this path, instead it is one continuous change two at a time, twice to go to the opposite Spin. if we look at the specific Turns in a Spin it is possible to see that with changing two at a time there are only three possible ways to achieve the full Spin. For the light matter side the Positive path through the Spin is to change the 1st and 3rd turns first followed by the 2nd and 4th. The Neutral Spin path is to change the 2nd and 3rd turns first followed by the 1st and 4th. Finally the negative path though the Spin is to change the 3rd and 4th first followed by the 1st and 2nd. 

Starting with the Charge theory a component of Will is engaged as a Charged personality will actually have the ability to Will a change from the Up position to the Down position. This is the path of Will that was described in the previous paragraph. In all actuality it is possible for the Spin to change in the Unwilled path as well, the direct compliment of the Willed path. So for the Positive path the Unwilled version is to have the 2nd and 4th Turns switch first followed by the 1st and 3rd. The Neutral and Negative paths have their own Unwilled versions as well.  Switching the 1st and 4th dichotomies first is the Neutral Unwilled path and switching the 1st and 2nd dichotomies first is the Negative Unwilled path.

An important note here is that for the antimatter quadrant the paths change. The negative path becomes the positive path and vice versa. The Neutral path stays the same, but for all three the Willed and Unwilled paths reverse as well.

(More details about what the paths look like for the antimatter and matter quadrants.)

A rule for the Neutrino theory is that the balance of positive and negative Turns will always be balanced. Therefore the Neutrino will always be neutral. Again starting with the Charge Theory positive and negative can become unbalanced. The following explains:

It is important to know which path the Spin takes because the combination of the light matter and dark matter quadrants of Spin create the full charge. No matter what path the Spin takes, that path is independent from the individual turns in the Up and Down positions. If the light and dark matter quadrants each have three possible positions then combined they create nine full charges. Those combined charges are given with the light matter half charge first followed by the dark matter half charge: neutral, neutral; neutral, positive; neutral, negative; positive, positive; positive, neutral; positive, negative; negative, negative; negative, neutral; and negative, positive. This leads to three full charges which are neutral, positive, and negative respectively. The Charge theory of PTP of necessity combines the light matter and dark matter quadrants into one. The light antimatter and dark antimatter combine into one as well generating its own set of nine possible combinations of full antimatter charges.

(More detailed information on each of the nine full charge types.)

Just as there is a light and dark matter combination that results in a Charged fermion, there is a light and dark antimatter combination that results in a Charged antimatter fermion. This second set of nine charged particles can be thought of as the alter ego that provides a give and take with the ego.

(More detail about the nine antimatter charge types.)

## Color Theory

Following the Personality Charge Theory is Personality Color Theory. And again another level of Will is required here. This time instead of three charged paths between two options as in the Charge Theory, there are four colored pathways. In the Charge theory there were three possible paths, but only one was ever used. This resulted in only one fixed charge. However, in the personality Color theory instead of Spinning back and forth between two positions along a single charged pathway, of the four possible Colored pathways two are fixed as the path between three charged positions. The core Charge point as well as two auxiliary Charged points. Further while the Charge theory results in fermions with some kind of Charge whether that charge is positive, negative, or neutral, the fermions always seek to balance out their different Spins and Charges moving to the Color theory. As a result different from in the Spin theory where all possible options were exhausted, in Color theory only those pathways that are balanced by spin and charge are options. As a result there are only six possible colored triplets. Here they are enumerated: 135, 147, 279, 258, 468,  and 369. The fermion can be any one of the 9 possible charged particles, but it can only be one of these six triplets. Each number is represented in these triplets twice. Therefore the charged fermion itself can travel either in one or the other. For example if the fermion is the charged particle 1, then it can either travel through the 135 triplet or the 147 triplet. In addition, according to Color theory the pathway to light matter or consciousness can only be one of the other two numbers. This leads to second bifurcation of the color pathway. Taking the previous example one step further, if the fermion charged particle only travels on the 135 triplet, then it can either go to the 3rd charged point the 3 consciously or the 5th point consciously. This is a result of the combination between the light and dark matter. So it is possible to identify that the Charged particle is one of four possible Colored outcomes. It doesn’t matter which Charged particle the fermion is its color is independent.

Like before in the Charge Theory, Will is again presented as an option. This time there are two pathways between three charged points with one of the charged points between the other two. By Will it is possible to travel from the core point to the conscious point or to the unconscious point. Also it is possible to travel the path to the conscious and unconscious points by the Unwilled path. This time the core point travels to the conscious charged point through its wings. The wings of the core point are simply the charged points to its sides. For example the wings of the 6th charged point is 5 and 7, the two adjacent charged points. Both adjacent points are utilized, however one of them leads to the conscious point and the other to the unconscious point. In transforming into the conscious or unconscious point the Color, Charge, and Spin change.

(Give more details about the possible paths for each Charged point.)

This is how the Charged particle gives rise to the Colored particles. In the Color theory itself, the last quadrants of the Spin theory are combined. Charge Theory combined light and dark, the conscious and unconscious defining how a fermion accesses both. In Color theory antimatter now combines with matter to create the full Color. Both matter and antimatter have ascended from Charge as one of four possible outcomes independent of both Spin and Charge. Matter now has three possible states that it can occupy and Antimatter pairs with Matter having its own three states. As Matter changes from one to another of its possible Charged and Spinned state it changes Color. However it only changes color to compliment the change in Antimatter Color resulting in the two always pairing in three possible states.

These states are the conscious, unconscious, and the neutral or masked state. These states pull and stretch each other….

(Give more details about the twelve possible ways in which Matter and Antimatter can pair in the three possible states.)

## Element Theory

The Color theory gives rise to the Element theory. Because the Matter/Antimatter combination can be described by a cube it can be seen that a single paired Matter/Antimatter combination has five possible options. The Element theory then has 5 possible Elements: Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire.
